# Cover Letter – Submission of Formal Grievance

**To:** KRISTINE.TOMASE@homebargains.co.uk

**From:** Michael Tint, Retail Assistant – Home Bargains Bracknell
**Date:** 16/11/2025

Private and confidential and without prejudice

Dear KRISTINE.TOMASE,

I am submitting the attached **Formal Grievance – Harassment, Intimidation, Health Neglect & Breach of Equality and Company Policy** for your review and investigation.

My primary intention is not to create conflict but to **find a fair and constructive resolution** that restores a positive and cooperative working environment for everyone. I have always valued teamwork and respect, and I believe we can move past recent misunderstandings if there is openness, communication, and fairness from all sides.

I want to make it clear that:
* I am **not making these complaints out of hostility** toward anyone. I have nothing personal against **Helio, Megan, Antonia, Ali, Kirsten, DJ, or Bradley**.
* I do not see any of them as enemies — I simply want clarity, fairness, and a healthy atmosphere at work.
* I apologise if this process causes anyone stress; that is not my intention. I would prefer we all put these issues behind us and rebuild the positive environment we used to have.
* I work **12 hours a week**, and I am not competing for anyone’s position or trying to cause problems. I simply want to be treated fairly and respectfully.

My main concerns are related to **my health needs** arising from diabetes — a condition that requires:
* **Regular meals and breaks at consistent times** to maintain stable blood sugar levels.
* **Frequent hydration**, meaning I need to **drink water regularly** throughout the shift.
* **Timely access to toilet facilities**, since diabetes can increase the need to urinate, especially when maintaining hydration.

These are not special privileges; they are essential medical requirements to manage my condition safely and effectively. I ask that management and colleagues understand and support this.

I truly hope this matter can be **resolved quickly, informally, and with mutual understanding**. I would appreciate confirmation that my grievance will be investigated and that appropriate steps will be taken to ensure a safe and respectful workplace for everyone.

I would also like to kindly request that we **do not discuss this issue on the shop floor** or during my next shift on Saturday. I hope we can all focus on working together productively and respectfully, leaving the past behind.

Thank you for your time, understanding, and cooperation. I believe that, with a bit of goodwill on all sides, this can be resolved positively and fairly.

Yours sincerely,
**Michael Tint**
Retail Assistant – Home Bargains Bracknell

# Formal Grievance – Harassment, Intimidation, Health Neglect & Breach of Equality and Company Policy

**Employee:** Michael Tint

**Position:** Retail Assistant

**Workplace:** Home Bargains – Bracknell

**Period Covered:** September 2024 – October 2025

**Date Submitted:** 16/11/2025

Private and confidential and without prejudice

⸻

## 1. Executive Summary

This grievance is raised under Home Bargains’ **Dignity at Work**, **Bullying and Harassment**, and **Equality & Diversity** policies, as well as the **Equality Act 2010** (Sections 6 and 9 – Disability and Race).

Over the past year, I have been subjected to repeated **harassment, intimidation, and unfair treatment** by certain colleagues, alongside **failures by management** to protect my health and uphold agreed reasonable adjustments relating to my diabetes.

The pattern of behaviour includes:
* Persistent **harassment and undermining conduct** by *Helio*, *Megan*, and *Antonia*;
* **Neglect and mishandling of health adjustments**, specifically repeated delays to my agreed **12:30 p.m. lunch break**, which I require to regulate blood sugar levels;
* **False and malicious allegations** intended to discredit me;
* A **deliberate and malicious act** involving my food being thrown away, despite it being kept for medical reasons;
* **Racial bias and differential treatment**, as I am of Asian background and the individuals involved are white;
* **Failure by management** to intervene appropriately, provide transparency, or protect me from retaliation.

These actions have collectively impacted my health, dignity, and wellbeing and have created a **hostile work environment**, breaching both company policy and legal obligations.

⸻

## 2. Background and Protected Characteristics

**Health Condition:** I have diabetes, which has been disclosed to management. This is a long-term condition classed as a disability under Section 6 of the **Equality Act 2010**.

**Agreed Adjustment:** I have an established agreement to take my lunch break at **12:30 p.m.** each shift to safely manage my blood sugar levels.

**Racial Background:** I am of **Asian ethnicity**, while the colleagues primarily involved in these incidents are white.

**Employment History:** I have maintained consistent attendance, followed all procedures, and conducted myself professionally. No formal action has been taken against me before these issues arose.

⸻

## 3. Statement of Grievance

### 3.1 Harassment and Intimidation

Helio has repeatedly made dismissive and unprofessional remarks, often in front of colleagues or customers. He has made unnecessary comments about my food, work performance, and duties, often intending to embarrass or provoke me.

Megan has publicly undermined me at the till during refunds, accusing me of being “demanding” in front of customers.

Antonia has contributed to false allegations and gossip, damaging my reputation and creating tension among staff.

These actions are consistent and mainly occur when these individuals are on shift together. This behaviour constitutes **harassment** under the **Equality Act 2010** and Home Bargains’ internal policy, as it creates an intimidating, hostile, and humiliating environment.

⸻

### 3.2 Health Neglect & Failure to Honour Adjustments

Despite management’s awareness of my diabetes and the agreed **12:30 p.m. lunch break**, this adjustment has been repeatedly delayed.

On **19 and 20 July 2025**, my lunch was postponed without explanation, leaving me weak and unwell during my shift and unsafe to drive home.

When I raised this, Helio made dismissive remarks such as “drink sugar water,” questioned whether I use insulin, and implied I was exaggerating symptoms.

This represents a **serious breach of duty of care** and a failure to implement a reasonable adjustment under the **Equality Act 2010, Section 20**.

⸻

### 3.3 Deliberate and Malicious Food Interference

A particularly concerning incident involved my food — which forms part of my diabetes management plan — being **thrown away** without my consent.

This food was known to management and colleagues to be kept for medical purposes. When I raised concerns, no one accepted responsibility, and management failed to explain who authorised this action.

This deliberate interference created a **direct health risk**, violated my dignity, and appears to have been maliciously intended to cause harm or humiliation.

If identified, the individual(s) responsible should face disciplinary action for **gross misconduct**, as this constitutes deliberate tampering with an employee’s health and safety.

⸻

### 3.4 False Allegations and Undermining Conduct

I have been falsely accused of “abandoning tills,” “causing kitchen mess,” and “sending customers to other tills.” None of these allegations have been supported by evidence such as CCTV or till logs.

These claims appear orchestrated to **discredit and isolate** me and have caused unnecessary stress and embarrassment.

⸻

### 3.5 Retaliation and Threats

When I raised concerns and mentioned my right to seek union advice, Helio responded by threatening a counter-complaint, stating he had his own union representative.

This was clearly intended to intimidate me and discourage me from exercising my protected rights — a form of **victimisation** under the **Equality Act 2010**.

⸻

### 3.6 Racial Bias and Discriminatory Treatment

All individuals consistently involved in these negative incidents are white.

As the only employee of Asian background regularly targeted in this manner, the pattern of baseless complaints, health neglect, and unprofessional treatment indicates **direct or unconscious racial bias**.

This constitutes **racial discrimination** under **Section 9 of the Equality Act 2010**, which prohibits less favourable treatment based on race or ethnicity.

⸻

### 3.7 Restriction of Toilet Access (Health & Safety Breach)

I also raise a serious issue regarding **restriction of toilet access** at work, which directly impacts my health and breaches **UK health-and-safety law**.

On **Saturday 11 October 2025**, at the Bracknell store, I pressed the buzzer to request a toilet break. **Bradley Sansum** questioned why I needed to go and seemed unwilling to allow it, even though there was **no queue** and the section was already closed. I informed him it was necessary and went briefly before returning to my duties.

A **week earlier**, a staff member with a headset told me to wait “five more minutes” before using the toilet because the queue was long. In reality, there was **no queue**, and I waited over ten minutes before **Helio** intervened, took over the till, and told me to go.

Both incidents demonstrate that I was **unreasonably denied timely access** to sanitary facilities. This breaches both **statutory welfare regulations** and **Home Bargains’ internal duty-of-care obligations**.

Under the **Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 (Section 2(1))**, employers must ensure, *so far as is reasonably practicable*, the health, safety, and welfare of employees.
The **Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 (Regulation 20)** require that:

“Suitable and sufficient sanitary conveniences shall be provided at readily accessible places and the use of such conveniences shall be readily available to employees at all times while they are at work.”

The **HSE guidance** further confirms that employers **must not unreasonably refuse or delay toilet access**, as this can endanger health and breach welfare standards.

By obstructing or delaying my toilet use, **Bradley Sansum** breached these laws and created unnecessary distress and risk.

This constitutes:
* A **breach of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 (S. 2(1))**;
* A **breach of the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 (Reg. 20)**; and
* A **failure of the employer’s duty of care** under company policy and common law.

I request a **formal investigation** and written confirmation that all employees will be permitted to use toilet facilities immediately when needed, without challenge or delay.

⸻

### 3.8 Misrepresentation and Misconduct by Ali

Around the same period, I spoke briefly with **Ali** about two people allegedly complaining about my food. This conversation was later **misrepresented**, and Ali appears to have passed **false information** to management.

His actions **initiated confusion and hostility**, escalating conflict within the store. Instead of clarifying facts or discussing matters professionally, Ali spread misinformation that has harmed my working relationships and reputation.

This behaviour shows **unprofessional conduct** and possible breach of Home Bargains’ **Code of Conduct** and **Dignity at Work Policy**.

I request that HR review Ali’s actions as part of this grievance and determine whether disciplinary measures or retraining are appropriate.

⸻

## 4. Management Failures

Management has failed in several key respects:
* To **investigate and prevent harassment**;
* To **uphold agreed health-related adjustments**;
* To **disclose complaints** made against me;
* To **protect me from retaliation** after raising legitimate concerns;
* To **address food tampering and welfare breaches**.

These represent a **breach of the employer’s duty of care** and internal **Dignity at Work** and **Equality & Diversity** policies.

⸻

## 5. Questions & Evidence Requests (Appendix A)

**To Antonia:**
– Provide the date, time, and evidence supporting any claim that I left my till unattended.
– Identify witnesses and reference any CCTV or till logs.

**To Helio:**
– Provide evidence or witness statements supporting any claim that I went to lunch without informing anyone.
– Provide shift logs or manager notes confirming this.

**To Management:**
– Provide full records of my **lunch breaks (clock-in/clock-out)** between September 2024 and September 2025.
– Confirm which manager was responsible for shift coordination on days when my lunch was delayed.
– Provide an explanation and investigation record regarding the **food disposal incident**, including who authorised or performed it.

⸻

## 6. Requested Remedies (Appendix B)

To resolve this grievance, I request:
* A **formal investigation** into the conduct of **Helio**, **Megan**, **Antonia**, **Bradley Sansum**, and **Ali**.
* Written assurance that my **12:30 p.m. lunch break** and **reasonable toilet access** will be honoured in all future shifts.
* **Full transparency** regarding complaints made against me.
* **Immediate action** to prevent further harassment or retaliation.
* A **formal written apology** and **disciplinary action** where misconduct is proven.
* Ongoing HR monitoring to ensure compliance and no future victimisation.

⸻

## 7. Declaration

I am submitting this grievance formally and in good faith.

My goal is to resolve these matters **professionally and constructively**, but I will not accept any attempt to “balance blame” or minimise what has occurred.

If these issues are not addressed fairly and transparently, I will consider **external escalation** for **discrimination**, **failure to accommodate a disability**, and **constructive dismissal**.
